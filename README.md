<p>My name is Vigneswaran Rajkumar, originating from the bustling city of Singapore. As the visionary behind The Acharya, I thrive on intricately weaving together frames and refining dialogues in my screenplays. When I’m not lost in the cinematic labyrinth, I’m busy conjuring up ingenious workflows and apps to sprinkle some magic into independent filmmaking.</p>
