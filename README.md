<p>My name is Vigneswaran Rajkumar, originating from the bustling city of Singapore. As the founder of <a href="https://theacharya.co" target="_blank">The Acharya</a>, I thrive on intricately weaving together frames and refining dialogues in my screenplays. When Iâ€™m not immersed in the intricate world of cinema, I devote my time to designing innovative workflows and applications that bring a touch of magic to independent filmmaking. Beyond this, I guide individuals on their journeys as <a href="https://soothsayer.life" target="_blank">Soothsayer</a>, a Vedanga Jyotisha Practitioner weaving divine ancient wisdom into modern lives.</p>
